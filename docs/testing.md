# Testing AWiki Me

AWiki Me keeps two test modes only:

```text
tests/unit/         # fast unit, widget, provider, and pure Dart tests
tests/e2e/          # desktop user-flow runner plus Flutter platform shims/support
integration_test/   # Flutter tooling shims only; do not put test logic here
.e2e/               # local E2E reports/state; ignored by Git
```

## Unit Test Gate

Run the full local unit/widget/provider suite:

```bash
dart run tests/unit/runner.dart
```

The unit gate must stay deterministic and Mac-friendly. It must not require a
real backend, real OTP, real CLI peer, Hermes, daemon, or mobile device. Focused
Flutter arguments can be passed through when debugging:

```bash
dart run tests/unit/runner.dart --name mention
```

The repository configures `package:sqlite3` to use the system SQLite library
through `hooks.user_defines.sqlite3.source: system`. This keeps the test gates
from downloading a prebuilt SQLite dylib from GitHub during native asset build
hooks. macOS provides SQLite by default. Linux runners need `libsqlite3-dev` (or
an equivalent package that exposes `libsqlite3.so`).

## E2E Gate

Run the local desktop smoke E2E:

```bash
dart run tests/e2e/runner.dart --case smoke
```

`smoke` starts real Flutter desktop integration shims for the app shell and
native IM Core smoke. It is the default high-frequency E2E gate for a Mac with a
normal Flutter desktop setup. It does not require test accounts, OTP, a backend,
or `awiki-cli`.

Run real App + CLI peer flows when a test backend and test OTP are configured:

```bash
dart run tests/e2e/runner.dart --case full
```

The full real-backend E2E runner reads local configuration from
`tests/e2e/configs/e2e.local.yaml` by default. Copy the tracked template first:

```bash
cp tests/e2e/configs/e2e.example.yaml tests/e2e/configs/e2e.local.yaml
```

Required local values:

- `service.baseUrl`: backend root, for example `https://anpclaw.com`.
- `service.didDomain`: DID domain, for example `anpclaw.com`.
- `otp.phone` and `otp.code`: the test OTP credential.
- `accounts.appUser.handle`: App-side test handle.
- `accounts.cliPeer.handle`: CLI peer test handle.
- `cliPeer.binary`: `awiki-cli` binary path.

E2E runtime configuration is read only from the YAML file. Command-line flags do
not carry backend, account, OTP, platform, or CLI binary values. Use
`--config <path>` only to select another YAML file.

When a real App + CLI peer run starts, the runner writes an internal
`.e2e/desktop-cli-peer/current/run_config.json` file for the Flutter integration
shim. This file is generated from the YAML config and should not be edited by
hand or committed.

Supported E2E cases:

- `smoke`: app shell + native IM Core smoke, no backend account required.
- `direct`: App and CLI peer direct-message flow.
- `group`: App and CLI peer group-message flow.
- `attachment`: App and CLI peer attachment flow.
- `contacts`: App and CLI peer follow/contact flow.
- `full`: all App + CLI peer flows.

All E2E runtime state and reports go under `.e2e/` and must remain untracked.
Local config files named `tests/e2e/configs/*.local.yaml` are also ignored and
must not be committed because they may contain OTP values.

## Flutter Integration Shims

Root `integration_test/*.dart` files exist only because Flutter desktop/mobile
tooling expects entrypoints there. Each shim imports the real implementation
under `tests/e2e/flutter/`. Do not add test logic to root shims.

Useful direct shim commands while debugging E2E internals:

```bash
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 flutter test integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart -d macos
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 flutter test integration_test/im_core_open_smoke_test.dart -d macos
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 flutter test integration_test/ui_visual_verification_test.dart -d macos
```

## Maintenance Rules

- Add ordinary logic, provider, and widget coverage to `tests/unit/`.
- Add user-flow E2E coverage to `tests/e2e/`.
- Keep root `integration_test/` as shim-only.
- Do not keep skipped, deferred, historical, or dry-run-only business scenarios
  in the active test tree.
- Do not commit local configs, OTPs, tokens, generated workspaces, or E2E
  reports.
